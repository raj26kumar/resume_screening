# resume_screening

In this project we take a resumes and predict, classify with the help of machine learning and see to which type of job resume belongs to.

* I used some NLP techniques for data preprocessing
* I used OnevsRestclassifier with knn classifer for predicting the category 

onevsRest classifier is a classifer, when we predict multiple categories it treat 1st catergory as only one and rest as one catergory
and like that it predicts the output
